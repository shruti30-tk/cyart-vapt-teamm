# Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Objective
To perform vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation on a vulnerable system using standard penetration testing tools.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- OpenVAS
- Metasploit Framework

## Workflow / Steps Performed

### 1. Target Verification
The target system (Metasploitable2) was verified for network connectivity using ping to ensure it was reachable.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
A full vulnerability scan was conducted using OpenVAS to identify potential security weaknesses and classify them based on severity.

### 3. Exploitation
Based on scan results, a vulnerable FTP service was exploited using Metasploit. Successful exploitation resulted in command shell access with root privileges.

### 4. Post-Exploitation
After gaining access, system information and privilege level were verified to confirm successful compromise.

### 5. Evidence Collection
A system file was hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm to demonstrate proper evidence collection and integrity verification.

## Conclusion
This task provided hands-on experience in performing a complete VAPT cycle, including scanning, exploitation, validation, and documentation.
